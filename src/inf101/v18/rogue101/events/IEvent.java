/**
 * An “event” is something that happens in the game, typically due to an actor taking some action
 * (nut could also be used to transmit user input) <p> Storing the particular action and it's
 * associated data in an object means that we can extend our system with many different kinds of
 * actions – and have many different reactions to those actions – without having to all of the "game
 * rule specific" stuff to all our interfaces and classes. <p> Our event objects let you store an
 * extra (arbitrary) piece of data, giving more information about what happened. An event handler
 * can also update this information, which is a possible way to report back to whomever caused the
 * event in the first place. The event objects also contain an event name, and source/targets of the
 * event (where relevant). <p> This system is fairly simplistic, and you're not expected to make use
 * of it.
